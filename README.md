# digit_recognizer

Since I am currently taking an interest in computer vision and therefore take a Stanford Course on Convolutional Neural Networks I was very interested in the digit recognition competition on Kaggle.
Please note that I have done this project as an introduction to the topic and it is heavily dependent on the following Kaggle Kernel uploaded by Yassine Ghouzam:

At a lot of points it is exactly the same code, since I did this to enhance my understanding of CNNs. Therefore this cannot be seen as an individual project done by me at this point.
I will however add a personal note to it as soon as I have fully grasped all the underlying concepts.
