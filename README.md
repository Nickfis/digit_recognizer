# digit_recognizer

Since I am currently taking an interest in computer vision and therefore take a Stanford Course on Convolutional Neural Networks I was very interested in the digit recognition competition on Kaggle.
Please note that I have done this project as an introduction to the topic and it is heavily dependent on the following Kaggle Kernel uploaded by Yassine Ghouzam:

Still, after creating the model using his approaches I will add a personal note to it.
